# PD (Personal Development) react-hook-form

## Purpose
Recently, react-hook-form was introduced to the team and implemented into the code base.
The purpose of this PD is to learn how to use react-hook-form by implementing it into a simple form and attempting to utilise it. 
this PD currently includes: 
- Single & multi form property validation rules
- Passing error message to Input component 
- TODO: implement regex on email property

It turns out to be an extremely easy to use and well documented module. I highly recommend react-hook-form and will continue to use it in all my future projects.
