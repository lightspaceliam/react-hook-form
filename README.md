# PD (Personal Development) react-hook-form

## Purpose
Recently a developer on the team I work in, introduced react-hook-form to the code base. So I wanted to familiarise myself with this module.
The purpose of this PD is to learn how to use react-hook-form by implementing it into a simple form and attempting to utilise it. 
Currently includes: 
- Single & multi form property validation rules
- Passing error message to Input component 
- TODO: implement regex on email property

It turns out to be extremely easy to use and well documented module. I highly recommend react-hook-form and will continue to use it in all my future projects.
